                <h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
                <p>There are a lot of places I have been but one of my most favorite is the Grand Canyon. I was only about 12 years old when I first saw the beautiful canyon. My family and I took a vacation to Las Vegas for a family reunion and we passed through a lot of cool spots, Grand Canyon being one of them. When I first walked up to the canyon, I was a little nervous. They dont have any guard rails to protect you from falling. The view was so beautiful that I quickly came over my fear and sat down on a ledge that was roughly 1600 feet from certain death. We stayed until the sun set and it was one of the most beautiful views I have ever witnessed. To this day, it is still one of my favorite places. I havent been back since but I am definitely going to make it back there someday.</p>

                <h2>Disney World</h2>
                <p>Disney World was really cool to visit. It was the biggest theme park I have ever been to. It was about 15 years ago when I was about the age of 10. I remember when we first got there, I was literally shocked by how many rides and attractions there were. Of course, I was too short to ride all the really cool rides but that didnt bring down my fun. They have a parade that goes on every two hours or so and a bunch of characters roaming around. We stayed in a hotel near the park and they had a monorail that took us right in. It was a lot of fun and I hope to bring my kids there one day, when I have some. </p>

                <h2>Las Vegas</h2>
                <p>Las Vegas was very interesting. I have only been there once, so far, and again it was when I was around the age of 12. I did not get to have any of the real fun that I would be able to have now that I am 24. So I would defiantly like to go back one day and actually take advantage of what Las Vegas offers, like the casinos and the awesome shows I have heard about. What I remember from my visit of Las Vegas is the malls and a really cool magic show that to this day I still dont know how he did half the stuff that I witnessed with my own eyes. The Malls were cool because they were underneath the main strip and stretched all the way down the road. They had the ceiling painted with clouds like the sky to make it seem like it was outdoors. They also had a canal down the middle to make it seem like we were in Venice, which I thought was really unique. When I go back I dont think I am going to be in the malls as much as the casinos though, which I think would be more fun.  </p>
